# the-first-test

This is a snake game and also my first github project.
That's probably all I can say.

## Pre-requests
At least [Python3.5](https://www.python.org/),
Python [blessed](https://pypi.org/project/blessed/) module,
Python [playsound 1.2.2](https://pypi.org/project/playsound/1.2.2/) module.

Keep in mind that playsound **should be 1.2.2 instead of 1.3**. 1.3 version has a bug that makes it unusable, at least for me.

Modules can be installed using pip:
```
pip3 install blessed playsound=1.2.2
```

### How to run?
Double-click the main.py and follow the in-game steps.

### How to play?
After setting the size, game will start. Use ARROW keys to move. Press P to pause.
